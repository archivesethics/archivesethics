The resources of the ICA, its Universal Declaration on Archives, its 1996 Code of Ethics have underpinned the principles of this guidebook, especially its code of ethics. As part of this project, the Archives at NCBS undertook two distinct tasks. The first was the development of guides on the legal frameworks that apply to archives in India. The second was the development of an ethical code that works together with the legal framework to help archivists make decisions in archival work that are both legal and ethical.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"appendix-1":{"id":"appendix-1","title":"Appendix I - Glossary and Notes","description":"Glossary","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"appendix-2":{"id":"appendix-2","title":"Appendix II - Further Reading and Resources","description":"How this section is organised","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-1":{"id":"chapter-1","title":"Chapter 1 - Acquisitions and Appraisals","description":"This chapter covers acquisitions, donations, deeds of gift, sale deeds, loans, copyright licenses and copyright assignments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-2":{"id":"chapter-2","title":"Chapter 2 - Access and Use of Archival Records - Copyright","description":"This chapter covers the application of the Copyright Act to archives, fair dealing and exemptions, the public domain, reproductions, defamation, liability, preservation, digitisation and public displays.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-3":{"id":"chapter-3","title":"Chapter 3 - Access and Use of Archival Records - Privacy and Data Protection Law","description":"This chapter covers data privacy, personal data protection, and informed consent.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-4":{"id":"chapter-4","title":"Chapter 4 - Public Records and Archive","description":"This chapter covers public archives including the National Archives of India, State Archives, and  the Right to Information Act and the Public Records Act.

While the statements are pithy, they are underpinned by many nuanced positions that cannot be contained within them. They reveal the positions and commitments that inform the statement of ethics. They also reinforce that ethics must respond to the context of the archives, the condition of their production, and their impact on their users, stakeholders and history. These positions are indicative of the intent to foster social justice, equitable representation, and a diversity of narratives. While each archive and archivist will implement ethical practice differently, the goal is to build archives that serve to promote these ideals. Some of these positions are expanded on here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-8":{"id":"chapter-8","title":"Chapter 8 - Some Frequently Asked Questions from Archivists","description":"Covers ethics of access, privacy, consent, triggering information, embargoes, historical value and public interest","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"colophon":{"id":"colophon","title":"Colophon","description":"Written and facilitated by Farah Yameen and Divij Joshi","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Archives and archival practice occupy a peculiar place among law, regulation and policy in India. Archives of all kinds have existed in India for decades. Besides the National Archives and various state archives administered by governments, there are organisational archives of corporations, scientific labs, newspapers or even individuals and families. But they have received scant attention from lawmakers, policymakers or the legal academy, as an institution that deserves specific legislative or policy consideration. Despite their significance as institutions of historical and political importance, archives and archival practice in India remain unacknowledged and understudied as an object of legal enquiry, as well as a subject of public policy. Yet, despite this conspicuous absence of \u2018The Archive\u2019 as a distinct subject of regulation, archival practice intersects with the law and regulation of property, media and information in distinct ways.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
