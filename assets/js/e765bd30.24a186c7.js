For one, it wishes to digitise and make available on the Internet certain records that it already holds, including photographs, manuscripts and diagrams, among other collections. In doing so, the archive must grapple with different paradigms of the legal regimes already encountered in this guidebook. For example, the risk of unwarranted disclosure of personal information is much greater if the information is placed on the Internet.

Two particular activities of archives are especially relevant to digital technologies. One, archives might wish to digitise their \u2018analog\u2019 collections to facilitate preservation or promote access to particular records (the becoming-digital archive). And secondly, archives or specific archival collections might be composed of digital material from their inception (the born-digital archive).

The \u2018three copy rule\u2019 in digital contexts is therefore anomalous. Similarly, the archival preservation of large volumes of born-digital content (such as archives of social media or of websites), are substantially more challenging in an environment where copyright work requires individual clearance for separate \u2018works\u2019 created online.
